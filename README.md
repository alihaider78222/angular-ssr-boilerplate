### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
angular-app/
|- node_modules
|- src
|- ...
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
src/app/
|- pages/
|- services/
|- app.component.html
|- app.component.ts
|- app.module.ts
|- app-routing.module.ts
|- app-server.module.ts
```

### Pages

This directory contains all the application top level Pages. A separate folder is created for each page as shown in example below:

```
pages/
|- home/
    |- home.component.html
    |- home.component.scss
    |- home.component.ts

```

### Services

This directory contains all the Services. A separate folder is created for each services as shown in example below:

```
services/
|- api/
    |- api.service.ts

|- seo/
    |- seo.service.ts

```

### Routes

`app-routing.module.ts` file contains all the routes for your application.

```
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "",
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
  {
    path: ":id",
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
]
```

### What is Angular hydration?

Angular Hydration is the process that restores a server-side rendered application on the client.

Without hydration, the browser would receive the server-rendered HTML, display it to the user, and then destroy and re-render the DOM when Angular initializes the client-side application. This could result in a visible UI flicker and negatively impact performance metrics like First Input Delay (FID) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
